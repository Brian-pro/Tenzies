# Tenzies
Tenzies is a dice rolling game where you roll 10 dice repeatedly until you get 10 of the same number.

This project was a project from the following scrimba course and we were tasked with adding additional features such as Tracking the time it takes to complete a game, tracking the amount ot rolls, and additionally I added the idea for making a whole section for recording your best game using localStorage:
